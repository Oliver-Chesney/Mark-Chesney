              Renewable energy For some years now I have worked in a hybrid of both the construction and finance
              industry. Recently like everyone I have taken an interest in the environment around us and the
              problem of global warming, looking at ways in which my industry experiences can be directed
              towards these problems in a positive way. I have been working with some of the best companies
              in the UK applying the skills gained over many years so that I can advise on the finance supply
              and install of the latest renewable energy technologies, helping people and companies to live
              and work smarter.

              Bushy housing When a client asked me to demolish his factory and build him four three storey houses,
              we decided to embrace new o+-site construction processes. So and so terrace was completed  in 2018,
              following the demolition of a joinery factory in Bushey High road and the pre site construction of
              the houses. Delivered, installed and made waterproof in less than 6 days I remain proud of this project.
