              Renewable energy For some years now I have worked in a hybrid of both the construction and finance
              industry. Recently like everyone I have taken an interest in the environment around us and the
              problem of global warming, looking at ways in which my industry experiences can be directed
              towards these problems in a positive way. I have been working with some of the best companies
              in the UK applying the skills gained over many years so that I can advise on the finance supply
              and install of the latest renewable energy technologies, helping people and companies to live
              and work smarter.

              Essex and Herts Air AmbulanceWorking with EAHAA was a privilege and an honour, being alongside some of
              the best people you will ever meet. Raising funds to help meet the annual Â£9 million pounds per year
              that it costs to keep pilots, doctors andparamedics in the air, saving hundreds of lives from Felixtowe
              in the East to Luton in the West was a fantastic and rewarding experience.

              Bushy housing When a client asked me to demolish his factory and build him four three storey houses,
              we decided to embrace new o+-site construction processes. So and so terrace was completed  in 2018,
              following the demolition of a joinery factory in Bushey High road and the pre site construction of
              the houses. Delivered, installed and made waterproof in less than 6 days I remain proud of this project.
